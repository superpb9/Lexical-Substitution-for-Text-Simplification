# Lexical-Substitution-for-Text-Simplification
A Project from Manchester Uni

Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be considered as a computer manipulation that applies a set of linguistic processing tools and techniques on natural languages. Text simplification is an important area of research in NLP that can modify and convert the complex text into a simplified one without changing its original meaning. Lexical substitution is one task of text simplification that reduces the lexical complexity while preserving the original meaning in the given context.
